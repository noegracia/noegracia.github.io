&lt;h2 id="sports-and-physical-activities">Sports and Physical Activities&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every day, I make sure to prioritize my physical well-being. My routine includes approximately 30 minutes of biking, which can vary depending on whether I&amp;rsquo;m working remotely or other factors. According to the World Health Organisation adults aged between 18-64 years should do at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, so I always like to do some cardio, moreover it makes me feel good. Apart from cardio I also like to do muscle strengthening. I usually do push pull legs workouts twice a week, whether it&amp;rsquo;s at the gym or at street workout parks. However, I also like doing diverse physical activities so I usually skip my workout days to do sports like tennis, volleyball, football, and even dance. My workouts are enough intense to progress but not too intense to be able to stick to my routine without being fatigued.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My setup</title><link>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/my-life/about-me/my-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 16:18:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/my-life/about-me/my-setup/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="setup">Setup&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>My coding setup consists of a dual-monitor arrangement and a high-performance PC featuring a GeForce 3080, an i7-12700KF, 64GB RAM 3200MHz, and a 2TB SSD. This configuration allows me to efficiently handle large datasets and run resource-intensive algorithms, enhancing my productivity.&lt;/p>
