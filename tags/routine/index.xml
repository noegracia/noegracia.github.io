&lt;p>The adventure began with anticipation as we gathered our gear, crampons and ice axes, essential for the challenge ahead. From the starting elevation of 1700 meters, we embarked on our ascent to 2140 meters, finding sanctuary at the Renclusa Refuge. Dinner was our prelude to rest, yet sleep proved elusive. At 9 PM, I nestled into my bunk, but the altitude, the cold, and a symphony of nocturnal noises (someone snoring) allowed for only two hours of light slumber.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My routine</title><link>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/my-life/about-me/my-routine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 16:18:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/my-life/about-me/my-routine/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="my-daily-routine">My Daily Routine&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Every day, I make sure to prioritize my physical well-being. My routine includes approximately 30 minutes of biking, which can vary depending on whether I&amp;rsquo;m working remotely or other factors. According to the World Health Organisation adults aged between 18-64 years should do at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, so I always like to do some cardio, moreover it makes me feel good. Apart from cardio I also like to do muscle strengthening. I usually do push pull legs workouts twice a week, whether it&amp;rsquo;s at the gym or at street workout parks. However, I also like doing diverse physical activities so I usually skip my workout days to do sports like tennis, volleyball, football, and even dance. My workouts are enough intense to progress but not too intense to be able to stick to my routine without being fatigued.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
