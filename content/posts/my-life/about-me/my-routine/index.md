# My Daily Routine

## Sports and Physical Activities

Every day, I make sure to prioritize my physical well-being. My routine includes approximately 30 minutes of biking, which can vary depending on whether I'm working remotely or other factors. According to the World Health Organisation adults aged between 18-64 years should do at least 150â€“300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, so I always like to do some cardio, moreover it makes me feel good. Apart from cardio I also like to do muscle strengthening. I usually do push pull legs workouts twice a week, whether it's at the gym or at street workout parks. However, I also like doing diverse physical activities so I usually skip my workout days to do sports like tennis, volleyball, football, and even dance. My workouts are enough intense to progress but not too intense to be able to stick to my routine without being fatigued.

## Meal Preps

Nutrition is a crucial part of maintaining a balanced lifestyle. I'm a dedicated meal prepper, ensuring that I have a nutritious meal ready for the next day to avoid long meal breaks. My meal prep is pretty simple. It always includes 3 important components: protein sources like chicken, salmon, or beef, coupled with carbohydrates like rice or pasta, and vegetables. On weekends, I allow myself to be more flexible, enjoying restaurant meals. I eat a lot of fruits, my favorites being bananas, kiwis and tangerines in season.

## Sleep

A good night's sleep is non-negotiable in my routine. I aim for a solid 7-8 hours of rest every night. To ensure a peaceful night's sleep, I have a calming bedtime routine. I brush my teeths, do my skincare and then I like to wind down with a good book; currently, I'm immersed in Brandon Sanderson's "The Final Empire". I make sure to close all windows and shut off every light, creating the perfect sleep environment.
