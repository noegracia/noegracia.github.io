# Ascending Aneto: Conquering the Pyrenees's Pinnacle

The adventure began with anticipation as we gathered our gear, crampons and ice axes, essential for the challenge ahead. From the starting elevation of 1700 meters, we embarked on our ascent to 2140 meters, finding sanctuary at the Renclusa Refuge. Dinner was our prelude to rest, yet sleep proved elusive. At 9 PM, I nestled into my bunk, but the altitude, the cold, and a symphony of nocturnal noises (someone snoring) allowed for only two hours of light slumber.

As I wake up at 6 AM, I had breakfast and then started our climbing non stop. For us novices, the path was not without its confusions; a few missteps cost us time but we could find our path by following experienced people that also were climbing the mountain. We trekked tirelessly until 1 PM, when we reached the 3000-meter mark and attempted to refuel. Altitude induced a sense of anorexia, making each bite of our sandwiches a laborious task. I managed only two-thirds of mine, despite usually having a robust appetite.

It was here that one of our friends, suffering from fatigue and having mountain sickness, chose to stay behind. The rest of us, determined, pressed on towards Aneto's zenith. Seven hours of climbing rewarded us with a panoramic spectacle, we had beauty in every direction. The ascent was arduous, but the inspiring views at every altitude, from the valley's charm at the base to the alpenglow of sunset painting the sky during our descent, were the true treasures of the journey.

Our descent back to the car at 1700 meters marked the culmination of a 12-hour odyssey, not counting the previous night's efforts. It was a 12-hour journey of traversing snowfields, dragging our legs through the snow, climbing, having lack of oxygen, falling in crevasses (hopefully not very deep ones). This grueling 15-hour journey was probably one of the most demanding physical feats I have ever undertaken.
